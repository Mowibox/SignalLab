Supervised learning implies using labeled data to train a model, wheras unsupervised learning does not, it trains with the data alone.\n","\n","* **What is an Activation Function?**\n","\n","Activation functions are non-linear functions applied like filters after a layer of a neural network to extract the main charactheristics of a layer. We have seen in our Image and Virtual Reality courses some of them, such as ReLU or sigmo√Ød.\n","\n","* **What is a Loss Function?**\n","\n","A Loss function calculates the deviation between the predicted values of a model and the actual values. The lesser the deviation, the better the model fits the expected values.\n","\n","* **What is a Multi Layer Perceptron?**\n","\n","The MLP is a neural network, divided on 3 parts : A input layer, one or several hidden layers and an output layer. All the neurons are connected from one layer to the next.\n","\n","* **What is a Convolutional Layer?**\n","\n","A Convolutional Layer is on of the layers of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It applies a convolution between the preceding layer and a Convolutional matrix called a kernel, in order to extract some useful features. For example, a Sobel matrix allow to extract the edges from pictures.\n","\n","* **What is the difference between MLP and Conv Layers?**\n","\n","In an MLP, each neuron in one layer  is connected to every neuron in the following layer, wheras Convolutional Layers apply kernels to extract features.\n","\n","* **What is the purpose of Gradient Descent?**\n","\n","The goal of Gradient Descent is to find the minimum of a function by adjusting parameters such as weights or biases. As such, it could be used to minimize Loss functions.\n","\n","* **What is the difference between a Forward pass and Backpropagation?**\n","\n","Where Forward pass is the way to process data from an input neural network until its output, backpropagation is the process of updating the data weights regarding the data received. \n","\n","Forward pass : From input to output\n","\n","Backpropagation : From output to input\n","\n","* **What is an optimizer?**\n","\n","An optimizer is an algorithm used to minimize the Loss function by adjusting weights during training. For example, Gradient Descent algorithm is one of them."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"57lJlFpkm8DN"},"source":["# II - Some Practice on Python "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PDJh15dpnoa7"},"source":["You might have used it before but let's do a quick refreshment.
